## Matplotlib_Exercise

## Background

This exercise uses matplotlib in python to produce pie charts and a bubble plot. 

## Instructions 

The script uses the csv to build a plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

Average Fare ($) Per City
Total Number of Rides Per City
Total Number of Drivers Per City
City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)


In addition, it produces three pie charts to show the following:
% of Total Fares by City Type
% of Total Rides by City Type
% of Total Drivers by City Type

## Dependencies 
pip install the seaborn library
