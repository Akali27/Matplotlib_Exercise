## Matplotlib Exercise: Ride Analysis

The script matplotlib_exercise.ipynb analyzes ride-sharing data for a fictional company called Pyber. The script reads data from two CSV files, one containing ride data and the other containing city data, and generates visualizations that provide insights into the company's performance in different types of cities (urban, suburban, and rural).

## Getting Started
To run this script, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter notebook installed on your machine along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Analysis 

The script uses the csv data to build a plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

- Average Fare ($) Per City
- Total Number of Rides Per City
- Total Number of Drivers Per City
- City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)


In addition, it produces three pie charts to show the following:
- % of Total Fares by City Type
- % of Total Rides by City Type
- % of Total Drivers by City Type
